I believe that there are no difficult tasks, its just things we know and things we are yet to understand. The one thing that took me a while to learn was the implementation of JWT which I put some extra effort into and was able to understand.

It was a really great experience where I got an opportunity to learn a lot of new technologies and to practically implement projects using the same which are currently live on the internet.


**NOTE: The online auto grader was not functional for me so I was unable to test my code there but did test it using "POSTMAN" and at "Localhost" using the browser.
